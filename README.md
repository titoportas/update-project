# titoportas/update-project-fields

Use this action to automatically update [GitHub project (beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) item fields.
Note that this action *does not support [GitHub projects (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards)*.
_The main difference between this lib and others is that you can use a PAT with repo and project scopes instead of org scope._

## Usage

_See [action.yml](action.yml) for [metadata](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions) that defines the inputs, outputs, and runs configuration for this action._

_For more information about workflows, see [Using workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)._

Create a workflow that will be triggered on Issues or Pull Requests events. It is highly recommended to use [add-to-project](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project) action before in order to find/create an item in your project and then send the itemId as input to `update-project-fields`.

Once you've configured your workflow, save it as a `.yml` file in your target Repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

### Example

#### Example Usage: Issue opened with labels `bug` OR `needs-triage`

```yaml
name: Create and/or Update edited issues to my project

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - edited

jobs:
  create-update-project:
    name: Add issue to project
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.3.0 # This adds the issue to the project
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/titoportas/projects/2
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GHPROJECT_SECRET }}
        id: add-project
      - uses: titoportas/update-project-fields@v0.1.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/titoportas/projects/2
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GHPROJECT_SECRET }}
          item-id: ${{ steps.add-project.outputs.itemId }} # Use the item-id output of the previous step
          field-keys: TextField,NumberField,FinishedAt,Size,IterationField
          field-values: foo,123,2022-09-01,üêã X-Large,[1]
```

## Inputs

- <a name="project-url">`project-url`</a> **(required)** is the URL of the GitHub project to add issues to.
  _eg: `https://github.com/orgs|users/<ownerName>/projects/<projectNumber>`_
- <a name="github-token">`github-token`</a> **(required)** is a [personal access
  token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `repo` and `project` scopes.
  _See [Creating a PAT and adding it to your repository](#creating-a-pat-and-adding-it-to-your-repository) for more details_
- <a name="item-id">`item-id`</a> **(required)** project item id to be updated. Important: this id is not the issue/pull_request number.
- <a name="field-keys">`field-keys`</a> **(required)** the github project field names separated with `,`.
- <a name="field-values">`field-values`</a> **(required)** the github project field values associated to the `field-keys` separated with `,`. If the key has values with special characters (_eg: ‚úÖ Done) you must include them.

## Creating a PAT and adding it to your repository

- create a new [personal access
  token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `repo` and `project` scopes
  _See [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for more information_

- add the newly created PAT as a repository secret, this secret will be referenced by the [github-token input](#github-token)
  _See [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for more information_
